# WeatherStation-

Introduction: 
When we want to check the weather, we always rely on our phones for help.These phones will take the information from the internet. Our goal is to create a device to detect the Humidity, Altitude, and temperature content which is also on the whole very portable. Problem with weather stations Portable weather stations are portable devices which can do the same things which were mentioned in the introduction above. The problem with this is that it is:

1. Heavy
2. And very expensive
Our Goal is to create a lightweight and very simple device to measure these stats.

Model Plan:
We will be using the Arduino Uno circuit along with the BMP 180 sensor which detects, air pressure, temperature and humidity, We will create a program which will display the criteria on an LCD Display screen and also this program will give suggestions. For example: it is 40°C- this device will give a suggestions like “A really hot sunny day today, not favorable to go outside”.

Future Plans: 
We will further be furnishing our model and probably will be working to get a proof of concept ready in the near future.
